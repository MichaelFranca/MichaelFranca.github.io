        <p>When Miami drew the Loyola-Chicago Ramblers as their Round of 64 opponents, many thought back to their memorable road upset of Florida early in the season. Since then, the Ramblers have gone on to win the Missouri Valley Conference and earn an NCAA tournament bid for the first time since 1985. This has resulted in Miami becoming a popular upset pick among college basketball analysts (and just about everybody else filling out a bracket), but what is it about Loyola that makes them so threatening? Well, in this article we’ll focus on their offense. The Ramblers didn’t get to this point through luck. The team's cohesion is evident in many ways, but most of all through their assist numbers.

        <p>To start, we can examine perhaps the weakest part of Ghezzal’s game: his goal-scoring. Over the course of his career he has averaged 0.24 goals per 90 minutes (understat.com). For comparison, Riyad Mahrez - the man he is tasked with replacing - has averaged 0.32 goals per 90 minutes in his career. The gap gets even smaller when using expected goals (xG).</p>
        <p>Expected goals is a statistical model that aims to calculate the numbers of goals a team or, in this case, player would be expected to score based on the quality and quantity of shots taken (definition via pinnacle.com). Ghezzal has averaged 0.23 xG per 90 which is just about average, while Mahrez has averaged 0.26...<a href="https://fosseposse.sbnation.com/2018/8/7/17661802/statistical-analysis-of-rachid-ghezzal-leicester-city-lcfc-xg-riyad-mahrez-demarai-gray-diabate">Continue</a></p>
